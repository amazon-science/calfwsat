This is an AWS-ARG-ATS-Science intern project developed by the intern
Joseph Reeves (jsreeves@) and manager Benjamin Kiesl (benkiesl@).

This code extends the solver yal-lin (Md Solimul Chowdhury, Cayden Codel, Marijn Heule), found at the [Github repository](https://github.com/solimul/yal-lin), which itself extended the solver [yalsat](https://github.com/arminbiere/yalsat) (Armin Biere).

  Options template for the solver.

  OPT (name, default, lowbound, upperbound, "description")

  when running the solver, use
  > ./solver --name=value 

  Default values are set for middle mile routing problems.
